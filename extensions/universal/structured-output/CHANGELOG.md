## 5.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 7b33e6f00: **Drift cleanup across extension packages: agent-facing text synced with actual behavior, dead surface removed**

  > Scope note: accumulated post-convergence cleanup across several development sessions. Every removal below was verified to have zero non-test consumers; runtime behavior is unchanged unless a bullet says otherwise. `src/` ships in these npm packages, hence minor where exported surface shrank.

  **ask-user: drop the dead `ErrorDetails` surface; docs aligned with the throw-based error contract**

  - The exported `ErrorDetails` interface is removed and `AskUserDetails` narrows to plain `Result`: since the W4 fix every error path in `execute` throws (pi marks the tool result `isError` with empty details), so the `{error}` details shape — and the `renderResult` branch rendering `✗ <error>` — was unreachable. Runtime output is unchanged; the removal only affects deep imports of `src/types.ts` (the package entry keeps exporting only the extension factory).
  - README/ARCHITECTURE synced to the shipped behavior: validation failures and headless tool removal documented as throws, `←/→` (not Tab) documented as the question-tab navigation keys, and the `allowComment` parameter dropped from the docs — it does not exist in the code.

  **cw-tool: `cw_query` tool description corrected on `details.data`**

  - The tool description now says `details.data` holds the parsed result whenever the command's stdout is parseable as JSON, instead of implying it appears only with `--json` — matching what the runner already does. README/SKILL drop stale cross-repo doc references.

  **goal: dead exports removed, never-consumed prompt parameters dropped, criteria validation deduplicated**

  - Dead exports removed: `BUDGET_PERCENT_HIGH` / `BUDGET_PERCENT_LOW` (constants) and `checkResumeBudget` (service); `goalStatusSeverity` and `getTitle` become module-private. The exported prompt builders `formatBudget` / `continuationPrompt` / `contextInjectionPrompt` drop the `timeUsedSeconds` placeholder argument that was explicitly `void`-ed — output text is byte-identical, but deep-import call sites should drop the argument.
  - successCriteria per-item validation (string / non-empty / single-line) is extracted into `adapters/success-criteria.ts` shared by the `goal_control create` tool path and `/goal update`; validation order and message wording are unchanged, only the `Correct:` recovery example is parameterized per channel.
  - README / CHANGELOG erratum / package description synced with shipped behavior: token-only budget (time budget removed), agent-reported blocking, append-only persistence with no entry GC.

  **scheduler: skip-reason wording and tool text synced with the delivery-kernel behavior; dead surface dropped**

  - `schedule_control run`'s `DISPATCH_SKIPPED` message no longer lists "busy" as a skip reason (`disabled, rate-limited, or already queued for delivery`) — non-force tasks are already enqueued in the session delivery kernel when the agent is busy and delivered once idle, and the message now says so. The `expires` parameter description notes it only applies to recurring tasks, the `run` guideline describes enqueue-then-deliver semantics, and the `/schedule` command description no longer promises a no-args TUI (bare `/schedule` returns a not-implemented notice pointing at `/schedule list`).
  - Dead surface removed: `ExecutionRecord.snippet` (declared, never populated), `SchedulerRuntime.getTaskCount()`, and the `note` field of `normalizeCronExpression`'s return type (now a plain string).

  **session-manager: tool descriptions aligned with actual runtime statuses**

  - `get_session_status` now documents status values as `active / idle / error` (not `running`), and `abort_session` says the final status will be `stopped` instead of an "aborted state" — matching what the xyz-agent runtime handler actually reports. README syncs the select-timeout tiers (create/history 60s, others 30s) and notes `list_my_sessions` takes no filter parameters.

  **session-reader: LLM-facing wording corrected across the tool surface; dead fields dropped**

  - Tool description and parameter descriptions now match the implementation: outline is a ~1500-token overview (render budget hard-coded at 2000), `turns` applies to detail and extract, `allBranches` applies to outline/export but not family, `source` filters find and session-resolving actions, TUI `#` references insert full uuids, and the current-session advice no longer names a nonexistent `get_messages` tool. Error and hint texts reworded for accuracy: an unmatched `sa-` id now says the record may not be flushed yet, and the truncated-outline hint points at `detail`'s `turns` range instead of a budget knob.
  - Dead optional fields removed from shipped types (`SessionRef.name`, `AutocompleteCandidate.description` — never populated), and the duplicated `formatOmitted` helper now reuses the exported `formatBytesMarker`.

  **structured-output: correction hints now spell the real tool name**

  - `CORRECT_USAGE_HINT` and the tool description's usage examples now write `structured-output(...)` — the registered `TOOL_NAME`, hyphenated — instead of `structured_output(...)`: an LLM following the old underscore spelling would call a tool name that does not exist. Comments re-anchor the cross-package schema-env contract to `packages/subagent-core`, and the npm description now covers both the workflow mode and the interactive Ajv-validated mode.

## 5.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 837f2faf6: (no changeset body; patch version bump)

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 23d8fe3cc: **structured-output: single-param workflow tool + bounded-failure loop gate**

  - Workflow mode (`PI_WORKFLOW_SCHEMA` present) now exposes a single-param tool: the authoritative schema is the tool parameters themselves (object roots get `additionalProperties: false`; non-object roots wrapped as `{value}` and unwrapped on execute). The dual-param self-reported form is preserved byte-for-byte for daily mode
  - Workflow branch execution is pass-through — the pi-ai param layer is the single validation authority; the redundant client-side ajv review was removed (it previously caused silent fix-loss)
  - New bounded-failure loop gate: 3 consecutive same-signature tool failures (signature change or success resets the count) terminates the session with a dual-channel log (stderr + session JSONL custom entry `structured-output:gate` including recovery guidance), preventing infinite retry loops
  - Failure surfacing, timer overflow, and opt-in edge-case fixes from adversarial audit rounds

## 5.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 63aa77435: Repo reorganization and dependency convergence for the 0.9.5 cycle

  - Extension packages are grouped into `extensions/taiji/` (xyz-agent integrated) and `extensions/universal/` (standalone); install targets and READMEs updated accordingly
  - earendil family dependencies converged to 0.84.1 (peer/dependency ranges updated)
  - llm-shared: export shared `getCurrentModelId` helper for model consumers
  - model-switch: consume the shared helper, internal simplification

## 5.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 246cd5e72: Split the monolith entry into six modules, harden the authoritative-schema validation path, and make `RetryState` explicit.

## 5.0.0

### Patch Changes

- 2eff0c7: No code changes in this package. It is published in this release only because it belongs to the linked group `[pi-structured-output, pi-subagent-workflow, pi-ask-user]` in `.changeset/config.json` — the subagent-workflow major bump forces the whole group to 5.0.0 to keep group versions aligned. Consumers should treat this as a version-only bump with no behavior change.

## 5.0.0-dev.0

### Patch Changes

- 2eff0c7: No code changes in this package. It is published in this release only because it belongs to the linked group `[pi-structured-output, pi-subagent-workflow, pi-ask-user]` in `.changeset/config.json` — the subagent-workflow major bump forces the whole group to 5.0.0 to keep group versions aligned. Consumers should treat this as a version-only bump with no behavior change.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- deafa7f: Fix silent schema-bypass in workflow mode: structured-output now validates data against the authoritative schema from PI_WORKFLOW_SCHEMA env instead of the LLM-supplied schema parameter. Workflow-mode prompts updated to guide LLM to pass only data.

  Workflow-mode structured-output prompt sync (subagent-workflow): the system-prompt instruction written by `resolveAgentOpts` for the `agent({schema})` override and the `formatSchemaInstruction` helper now instruct the LLM to pass ONLY the `data` parameter and do NOT pass a `schema` parameter, because the schema is enforced by the system.

## 2.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 83e97ab: Integrate xyz-pi-extensions into xyz-agent monorepo

  - Migrate 17 @zhushanwen/pi-\* extension packages from standalone repository
  - Unify typebox imports to @sinclair/typebox across all extensions
  - Add unit tests for vision, quota-providers/cache, model-switch/advisor+setup
  - Fix type safety issues (PiAPI=any, TUnsafe compatibility)
  - Clean up migration residue (dead aliases, dangling symlinks, stale comments)

## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 9169119: Migrate all Pi SDK references from the deprecated `@mariozechner/pi-*` namespace to the active `@earendil-works/pi-*` namespace. This eliminates the five deprecation warnings emitted during `pnpm install` (`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, `@mariozechner/pi-tui`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, transitive `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`, and transitive `node-domexception`).

  **Changes:**

  - **package.json**: all `peerDependencies` / `peerDependenciesMeta` referencing `@mariozechner/pi-*` updated to `@earendil-works/pi-*` (versions unchanged: `*`)
  - **TypeScript sources**: all `import ... from "@mariozechner/pi-*"` updated to `import ... from "@earendil-works/pi-*"` across 98 files (438 import occurrences including `declare module` and dynamic `import()` types)
  - **`tsconfig.json` paths**: removed `@mariozechner/pi-*` dual-alias entries; kept only `@earendil-works/pi-*`
  - **`vitest.config.ts` aliases**: removed `@mariozechner/pi-*` entries; updated stub path targets to `./shared/types/earendil-works/index`
  - **`shared/types/mariozechner/` → `shared/types/earendil-works/`**: stub directory renamed, `declare module` names updated, `shared/types/package.json` `main` and `files` fields updated
  - **Monorepo cross-package references**: `extensions/ask-user` (`@zhushanwen/pi-subagent-workflow`) and `extensions/subagent-workflow` (`@zhushanwen/pi-structured-output`) switched from `*` to `workspace:*` so local development uses the just-edited sources instead of pulling deprecated versions from npm
  - **`pnpm.allowedDeprecatedVersions.node-domexception = "1.0.0"`**: silences the remaining unavoidable transitive deprecation (`@earendil-works/pi-ai` → `@google/genai` → `google-auth-library` → `gaxios@7` → `node-fetch@3` → `node-domexception`); `node-domexception` is a Node 22+ redundant polyfill, not a functional issue

  **No functional changes** to extension behavior, types, or APIs. `pnpm install`, `pnpm -r typecheck`, and `pnpm -r test` all pass cleanly with zero deprecation warnings.

  **Follow-up hardening (no functional impact):**

  - **`.githooks/validate-no-mariozechner-pi`** (new): standalone grep-based scanner that errors when `@mariozechner/pi-` appears in staged files or in workspace path checks. Can also be called manually for ad-hoc audits (`bash .githooks/validate-no-mariozechner-pi [<files>]`).
  - **`.githooks/pre-commit`** (`-0.` namespace check): wired `validate-no-mariozechner-pi` as a pre-manifest gate. Any staged file in `extensions/` or `shared/` (including `package.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `.d.ts`) containing the deprecated namespace blocks the commit. `SKIP_NAMESPACE_CHECK=1` hotfix bypass must be justified in the PR description and tracked with an issue.
  - **`.githooks/pre-commit`** (`0b` peerDep check): the package.json deep check now requires `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` and explicitly rejects `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` (was incorrectly accepting the deprecated name as the success signal).
  - **AGENTS.md** new section "禁止使用已废弃的 Pi SDK namespace [MANDATORY]": documents the namespace rule, the gate script location, and what to do if Pi renames the namespace again.
  - **docs/standards.md / docs/monorepo-conventions.md / docs/quality-gates.md**: updated example `package.json`, import snippets, and `peerDependencies` descriptions to use `@earendil-works/pi-*`. Old historical docs (`docs/evolution/`, `docs/third-party-extensions/`, `docs/research/`) retain the deprecated references as factual record of past investigations.
  - **Bonus fix**: `pre-commit` had a latent bash bug `${#TEST_PKGS[@]:-}` (not a valid parameter expansion). Fixed to `${#TEST_PKGS[@]}` while validating the new gate.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- bb86ee9: Harden 5 tool descriptions + runtime validation against weak-model first-call parameter misuse.

  Triggered by a real session where a flash-tier model (step-3.7-flash) called the `subagent` tool with `task`/`slug` flattened to the top level (missing the `startParam` envelope) and needed a round-trip to self-correct. Root cause analysis found a systemic debt pattern across 5 tools: conditional-required fields expressed as `Type.Optional`, zero JSON call examples in descriptions, no parameter-structure anti-patterns, dry runtime error messages with no Correct example, and no prompt-quality regression tests.

  Three-layer fix applied uniformly to all 5 tools (subagent + workflow + goal_control + todo + ask-user + structured-output):

  - **Runtime friendly correction**: required-field throws now append a copy-pasteable `Correct: {full JSON}` example; common-misuse detectors catch the highest-frequency errors and return a corrected shape (subagent `startParam` flattening; workflow `args` sub-field flattening — a P0 silent failure; todo `text`/`texts` + `id`/`ids` dual-shape trap; ask-user string `options` array).
  - **Description examples + structural anti-patterns**: each tool now ships complete JSON call examples for every high-risk action and a Don't section listing parameter-structure mistakes.
  - **Prompt-quality regression tests**: new source-text assertion test per tool locks the examples / anti-patterns / Correct-usage strings so they cannot silently regress.

  Notable silent-failure closures (worse than the original throw-based failure because they did not error at all):

  - **structured-output**: `schema`/`data` swap detection + keyword-less schema rejection. Previously `Type.Unknown()` + `ajv strict:false` compiled a keyword-less object (e.g. `{}`, `{a:1}`) into an accept-anything validator — swapping schema and data then passed validation and stored garbage silently. Now detected and rejected with a Correct hint.
  - **workflow**: flattened `args` sub-fields (task/items/...) previously fell through to `args = params.args ?? {}`, silently launching a run missing its parameters.

  Other changes:

  - **subagent + workflow**: `slug` `maxLength` relaxed 20 → 35 (single source `SLUG_MAX_LENGTH`; both schemas now reference the constant). Descriptive kebab-case slugs like `fix-subagent-wf-tools` (21) no longer collide; over-limit error now suggests a shorter label.
  - **ask-user**: `InputSchema.options` element intentionally loosened to `OptionSchema | string` so a mistyped string-array `options` reaches `validateInput` (friendly Correct error) instead of being killed by the schema layer's raw ajv error before `execute` runs. Internal `Question`/`Option` types stay strict.
  - **structured-output**: extracted `executeStructuredOutput()` for direct unit testing (internal test helper — not re-exported from the package root, so not part of the public API); deleted stale `STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_SCHEMA` env-name + tool_call block tests (0.3.0 changed to unconditional registration, real env name is `PI_WORKFLOW_SCHEMA`).

  Review follow-up (addressed in the same PR after a 6-dimension multi-agent code review):

  - **structured-output**: `SCHEMA_KEYWORDS` completed with the remaining draft-07 validation keywords (`if`/`then`/`else`/`dependencies`/`propertyNames`/`contains`/`$defs`/`definitions`) so a conditional root schema is no longer wrongly rejected as keyword-less; `executeStructuredOutput` return type widened from `Record<string,unknown>` to `unknown` (data may be a primitive/array per its own tests); `getOrCompileValidator` now accepts `object | boolean` (boolean root schemas are valid draft-07), eliminating an unsafe cast; `tool_execution_end` handler uses a runtime type guard instead of a bare cast; `echo()` now tolerates `undefined` (`JSON.stringify(undefined)` returns undefined and previously crashed `.length` — a latent bug surfaced by the new edge-case tests).
  - **subagent-workflow + todo**: detectors (`hasFlattenedStartFields`, workflow `findFlattenedArgKeys`, todo `handleAdd`/`handleDelete`) now exported to enable behavioural trigger/no-trigger tests — the P0 workflow flatten detector previously had only a fragile source-text lock. Added slug boundary tests (35/36) and a workflow-side runtime slug guard matching subagent's.
  - goal_control `hasGoalDetails` guard tightened to validate the `details` value is an object (not just that the key exists).

  All five packages are bumped `patch`: no breaking API changes, no new public exports forming a supported API contract (the exported detectors are test helpers, not a stable surface), and the ask-user schema loosening + structured-output keyword-less rejection only surface clearer errors for inputs that were already malformed (previously silently corrupted or raw-ajv-rejected). This is defensive hardening + prompt-quality work, conservatively versioned as patch.
