## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- a769aea2f: Fix a pi-process crash caused by a leaked tick timer after session replacement:

  - **Root cause**: when a scheduled task dispatch was inside its `await sendMessage` window and the session got replaced (`new_session` / `switch_session`), the old 30s tick timer could survive. Its next tick called `refreshWidget` on the captured stale ctx whose `ui` getter throws, and the fire-and-forget `void tickScheduler()` turned that rejection into an `unhandledRejection` that killed the pi process (exit 1).
  - **Source fix**: the `session_start` handler now stops the prior runtime's timer first (`service?.runtime.stopScheduler()`) — an idempotent guard against multi-fired/re-entered `session_start` leaking the previous interval. On the production factory-rerun topology (`newSession`/`fork`/`switchSession`), pi re-runs the extension factory and the new closure's `service` is still null at `session_start`, so this stopScheduler call is a no-op there — the real stop point for those replacement paths is the `session_shutdown` teardown that pi awaits (fires) before creating the replacement runtime.
  - **Defense in depth**: the tick interval callback now catches tick rejections, and stale-ctx triage runs in two layers. Primary: a module-level session generation counter — every `session_start` increments it, each runtime captures its generation at construction, and ticks bail out early (or self-retire on in-flight errors) once the generation flips. This covers the session replacement paths (`newSession`/`fork`/`switchSession`), where pi re-runs the extension factory but the cached factory shares one module environment, so the counter survives across factory re-runs. Fallback: stale-ctx error text matching ("stale after session replacement") covers the residual blind spot — an explicit reload (or cwd change) clears pi's extension cache and re-imports the module into a fresh environment, freezing the old closures' generation reference; there, only the error text can still identify a stale ctx. Other errors warn and keep scheduling. The timer is deliberately not `unref`-ed — in rpc/daemon mode that would let the process exit early and kill scheduled tasks.
  - **Companion hardening (not part of the crash fix itself)**: `dispatchTask` now keeps a per-task in-flight guard. A tick is fire-and-forget, so if a dispatch's `await sendMessage` hangs longer than the 30s tick interval (e.g. pi unresponsive), the next tick could start a second dispatch of the same task and double-inject the prompt (force tasks bypass the idle gate). The guard skips the task for that tick with a warning and clears on settle; other tasks are unaffected. Included here because it hardens the same dispatch path the crash fix touched, but it prevents duplicate task execution rather than the crash.

### Minor Changes

- 1565e57fa: **Shared LLM/config library + config path consolidation (first release of `@zhushanwen/pi-llm-shared`)**

  - **pi-llm-shared (new)**: shared library for extensions — generic config IO (`<agentDir>/config/<pkg>-ext-config.json`, mtime+size read-through cache, atomic write), unified LLM call helper (`callLLM`), `ModelSelector` resolution (ref/fallback/available/scoped), and `migrateLegacyConfig` (idempotent best-effort rename used by session_start migration hooks). Note: must publish together with (or before) its consumers below; the packages resolve it via `workspace:*`.

  - **pi-permission**: config file moved from `<agentDir>/permission-config.json` to `<agentDir>/config/permission-ext-config.json` (one-shot idempotent migration on session_start, old file removed after move); LLM classifier plumbing now goes through pi-llm-shared (`callLLM` + `ModelSelector`); classifier model `auto` semantics now pick the first available scoped model instead of the globally cheapest.

  - **pi-rename-session**: switch and settings now live in `<agentDir>/config/rename-session-ext-config.json` (`enabled` / `model` / `maxTitleLength`); title generation uses an independent slim system prompt with explicit `tools: []` and its own model selector (default `scoped`) instead of piggybacking the main session model. The legacy `<agentDir>/auto-rename-enabled` flag file is kept as a live override (checked every turn) so the released xyz-agent runtime toggle keeps working — `/auto-rename on|off` syncs both mechanisms.

  - **pi-model-switch**: config file moved from `<agentDir>/model-policy.json` to `<agentDir>/config/model-switch-ext-config.json` (session_start migration); new `model-switch-ext-config` skill documenting schema and defaults.

  - **pi-scheduler**: new `scheduler-ext-config` skill (cron/interval formats, JSONL event-sourcing storage); legacy store import now resolves candidate dirs via `getAgentDir()` so isolated agent dirs (`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) work.

  - **pi-quota-providers**: quota cache moved from `<agentDir>/statusline_cache.json` to `<agentDir>/config/quota-cache.json` (first-load migration, old cache ignored → cold refetch); all paths derive from `getAgentDir()` for instance isolation.

  - **pi-subagent-workflow**: fix worktree registry pid staying 0 in RPC mode (reaper could reap live worktrees after grace timeout — pid is now registered right after spawn); skill/session-dir resolution derives from `getAgentDir()` instead of hard-coded `~/.pi/agent`.

  - **pi-plan**: global plan-template directory derives from `getAgentDir()` so isolated agent dirs (`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) are respected.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 54895962b: Migrate task store to session-scoped append-only CustomEntry storage

  - Replace file-based task store with append-only CustomEntry records written to the session JSONL, so scheduled tasks survive session resumption and are scoped per session
  - Add legacy store importer that migrates existing `tasks.json` data on first run
  - Fix toggle-enable not persisting recalculated `nextRunAt` (tasks lost scheduling after resume)
  - Fix residual pending tasks when toggle-enable recalculates `nextRunAt` to the future
  - Trim once-task echo to a single run and inject the `now` source for consistent scheduling

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 246cd5e72: Extract `SchedulerBackend` and unify tool/command dispatch through `SchedulerService`. Fix the cron fallback loop and correct the misleading "every X" display for once tasks (now shown as "once in X").

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 83e97ab: Integrate xyz-pi-extensions into xyz-agent monorepo

  - Migrate 17 @zhushanwen/pi-\* extension packages from standalone repository
  - Unify typebox imports to @sinclair/typebox across all extensions
  - Add unit tests for vision, quota-providers/cache, model-switch/advisor+setup
  - Fix type safety issues (PiAPI=any, TUnsafe compatibility)
  - Clean up migration residue (dead aliases, dangling symlinks, stale comments)

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- Publish as public package via .npmrc access=public.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- Publish with --access public for first-time scoped package.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- b4b9fa5: Fix cron expression parsing in /schedule command: add quote-aware tokenizer so quoted cron expressions (e.g. `cron '*/10 * * * *' prompt`) are correctly handled.
